Two-Pointer Approach
The solution employs a classic two-pointer approach to efficiently find the pair of numbers with the desired sum. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

Initialize Pointers: Start with two pointers, i and j, pointing to the beginning and end of the array, respectively. In the code, i is initialized to 0, and j is initialized to numbers.length - 1.

java
Copy code
int i = 0;
int j = numbers.length - 1;
Iterate While i < j: Use a while loop to iterate through the array until the i pointer is less than the j pointer.

java
Copy code
while (i < j) {
    // Check conditions and update pointers
}
Check Sum: Inside the loop, calculate the sum of the elements at positions i and j. There are three possibilities:

If numbers[i] + numbers[j] equals the target, the solution is found. Store the indices i + 1 and j + 1 in the ans array and return it.

java
Copy code
if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] == target) {
    ans[0] = i + 1;
    ans[1] = j + 1;
    return ans;
}
If the sum is greater than the target, decrement the j pointer. This is because, in a sorted array, reducing the larger element might help in finding a pair with the target sum.

java
Copy code
else if (numbers[i] + numbers[j] > target) {
    j--;
}
If the sum is less than the target, increment the i pointer. This is because, in a sorted array, increasing the smaller element might help in finding a pair with the target sum.

java
Copy code
else {
    i++;
}
Return Default Answer: If no solution is found within the loop, return the default answer array, ans, which is initialized to [0, 0].

java
Copy code
return ans;
Complexity Analysis
Time Complexity: The solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because each iteration of the while loop either increments i or decrements j, and in the worst case, it iterates through the entire array once.

Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(1) since the solution uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the size of the input array.

Conclusion
The two-pointer approach is a powerful technique for efficiently solving problems involving sorted arrays and searching for pairs or subarrays with specific properties. In this case, it helps find the indices of two numbers that add up to the target sum in a sorted array.
